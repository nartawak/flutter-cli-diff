# Flutter Cli diff

This repository exposes an Flutter CLI app generated with
`flutter create flutterdiff --no-pub --org nartawak -i objc -a java` with each version of Flutter CLI.

A dedicated branch per version makes changes very easy
to watch. For example:

* https://github.com/nartawak/flutter-cli-diff/compare/v0.0.10...v0.0.11
* https://github.com/nartawak/flutter-cli-diff/compare/v0.1.3...v0.3.1

See table below for the complete list.

Note that this is inspired by [Angular Cli diff](https://github.com/cexbrayat/angular-cli-diff) & [RN diff](https://github.com/ncuillery/rn-diff).
